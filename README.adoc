= Rust Premier League Standings

This Rust program fetches and prints the current standings of the English Premier League from the football-data.org API.

== Prerequisites

Before running the program, you need to have Rust and the dotenv package installed on your system.

== Getting Started

To run the program, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory in your terminal. Then, create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following line to it:
[source]
API_TOKEN=<your football-data.org API token>

Replace <your football-data.org API token> with your API token from football-data.org.

Once you have set your API token, run the program with the following command:

The program will fetch the current standings from the API and print them to the console in a formatted table.
